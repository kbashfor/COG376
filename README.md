# COG376 - Natural Language Processing

This was a project for COG376 that used Scala to do NLP rather than Python and the NLTK. This program used Maven, Intellij, Scala Build Tools, and Standford Core Nlp in order for this to run.

To input a file into the demo.scala, you need to uses the full directory path rather than the current working path.

`/home/kyle/test/temp.txt` or `C:\users\kyle\test\temp.txt`
