Dan Wells joins Nautilus Footwear, America's fastest growing safety shoe company, as Vice President Nursing Division.
"We have ended 2000 with record sales and earnings. Phase 3 of our strategic plan is to clearly separate our three business units of industrial,
nursing and public safety. Dan will lead our Nursing strategy and drive the efforts of our nursing sales team. The clear separation of our
Nursing business is a natural for us as we have been a leader in the nursing arena since beginning the company in 1996," said Wayne Easley,
President / CEO. "Dan comes to us with an extensive background in the footwear industry most recently with Berkshire Hathaway's,
Lowell Shoe Company. He has solid account and product knowledge that can clearly continue to deliver our 'ergonomic message' to the Nursing community,"
added Elsey.
